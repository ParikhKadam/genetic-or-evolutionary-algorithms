## Common Concepts

### Motivation

In short, a set of organisms is selected. Then they are altered either using mutation or crossover in order to create new organisms. Now, from among this newly created organisms, the ones which suit/adapt the best, for the task/to the environment, are selected.

### Mutation and Crossover

1. What is the difference between “mutation” and “crossover”? - https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/9076/what-is-the-difference-between-mutation-and-crossover
